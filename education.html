							When I was 6 years old, I got my early education at  "Taska Al-Firdaus Jalan Kebun". 
							At there I got many friends and learn many things. For example, I learned to recognize the alphabet, 
							numbers, colours, shapes and more.Basically, I learn a basic knowledge in the kindergarten.
							There is not much to remember because I was to young but what can I remember 
							is I have a lot of friend back there, and a beautiful and caring teachers, Her names is Puan Rohana
							and she is really amazing teacher. Kindergarten is a place where we learn our journey in the early education
							and most of the kindergarten time full of joy and happiness because of we are so young and we are children
							what we do is we play, we cry, we happy. For me the most beautiful journey of memory is when we are in the
							kindergarten time. Sometime we remember what we learn but most of the time is what we play in the kindergarten.

							Workshop Block, School Field, Mini Stadium and Multipurpose Court.
							I was Study there from 2013 until 2017.And I got my PT3 in 2015 and SPM in 2017 at that school.
							When I was in primary school, I learn advance knowledge and it is quite hard but I still success.
							During this time, it was really amazing journey, when I remember it there were a lot of memory that 
							I really missed. I was bonded with my friends for about five years, thus there were many
							memories, lessons, and experiences.. But when we were graduate or finish our SPM  we are no longer as close 
							as we used to be, because each of us has own path to follow to achieve our own mission, ambition and dream.

					Furthermore, after I took SPM in 2017, I then continued my study at UiTM Jengka, Pahang 
					where I am a pre-diploma student at there for almost 6 moths.I had never been apart from my family before.
					This is the first time, so it was not easy, but I'm slowly learning to adjust to my surroundings and make new
					friends and learn how to survive in the Univerisity life.Then after finishing my pre-diploma 
					I continued my study at UiTM Merbok, Kedah. As a diploma student in a library management course. 
					I studied at UiTM Merbok from 2019 until 2021 for almost 3 years. Therefore, that 
					is all about my education background.
